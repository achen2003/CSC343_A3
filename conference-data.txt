Notes:
This data is described in a way that is not intended to suggest what your
database design should be! This data is loosely based on some real conferences,
but is not intended to be accurate. 

This data was very loosely inspired by https://uoftcsed.github.io/pubs/

You are welcome to use that list   for inspiration for the rest of your data,
but you do not have to. 

//Khushi's notes
- figure out chair id as well
- add rejections for those not presenting
- all accepted submisisons should be presented as well
- 33 submissions
- 33 accempted
-- ill make myself the dummy author that reviews everyone's work
different sessions need:
- for presentation we need to find all the accepted submissions
- we need conf_id, sub_id, s_type 

- add facilitator
- add author order for submissions
- add accept/reject for every single submission
